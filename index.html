    <p>
      One day over a dinner with a friend, we discussed the <a
        href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/displaying-verification-statuses-for-all-of-your-commits">
        vigilant mode</a>,
      which is a feature on the GitHub platform used to verify cryptographic signatures in commits.
    </p>
    <p>
      The outcome of the conversation was that if Git and GitHub support verification of signature in commits, then
      there must be a reason for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the following post, I will try to shed a bit more light on this topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have created a <a href="https://github.com/Cupprum/git-gpg-signing">new public repository</a> in GitHub.<br>
      Let's clone the repository and add an initial commit and see the result in Github.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
  # Clone.
  > git clone "git@github.com:Cupprum/git-gpg-signing.git"
  > cd git-gpg-signing

  # Config.

  # Create commit.
  > echo "Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so." > test.txt
  > git add test.txt
  > git commit -m "committed by Cupprum as Cupprum"
  > git push
    </code></pre>
    <img src="img/commit_cupprum_as_cupprum.png"
      alt="Picture of commit on GitHub, the commit shows that its created by me.">
    <h2 style="color: #555;">
      How does GitHub make sure I am really me?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Who am I even? That is a better question.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a user! I configured Git with my information. However, Git is a tool whose main purpose is a <a
        href="https://git-scm.com">"distributed version control system"</a>.<br>
      GitHub is the platform here. GitHub is used as the main server (even though Git is distributed). People use GitHub
      as a service for collaboration on code-bases, therefore all the identity and access management has to be done on
      the
      side of GitHub.
    </p>
    <p>
      The terms Authentication and Authorization are sometimes used interchangeably, however they have different
      meanings.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a
        href="https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/identity-fundamentals/authentication-and-authorization">Authentication
      is the process of verifying who a user is, while authorization is the process of verifying what they have access
      to.
      </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two primary methods for communication with a GitHub repository, each using different security mechanisms
      for authentication purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first method is facilitated through SSH, utilizing asymmetrical cryptography.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second method involves the use of HTTPS, wherein a Personal Access Token (PAT) serves as the means of
      authentication.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I push a commit to a repository, my local Git authenticates against GitHub (using SSH or PAT) and the
      authenticated profile is authorized to execute the <i>push</i> functionality. Authentication in this case means
      that the person who pushed the commit to GitHub is a user on the GitHub platform. Authorization means that the
      GitHub user is authorized to push commits to the repository.
    </p>
    <p>
      By nature Git is distributed. This allows for different types of workflows. They are discussed more in the
      following <a href="https://git-scm.com/about/distributed">About Git section</a>. But the workflow I want to
      highlight is the following.
    </p>
    <img src="img/integration_manager_workflow.png"
      alt="Picture of Integration Manager Workflow from https://git-scm.com/about/distributed.">
    <p>
      <b>What if I want to push a commit created by a different person?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      By default, GitHub cannot verify who created the commit because the commit does not contain any secret to prove
      its origin. However, there is an option to create a special type of branch, <a
        href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches#require-signed-commits">
        the protected branch</a>, which can enforce that only commits which were signed, and therefore contain
      a secret, can be pushed to the specific branch.
    </p>
    <h2 style="color: #555;">
      What does a commit look like?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Luckily there are already many great existing resources which explain this topic much deeper. <a
        href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects">The Official Git Book</a> or <a
        href="https://youtu.be/lG90LZotrpo?feature=shared&t=720">talk by John Britton of GitHub</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      What's important for us here is that commits are snapshots of the <a
        href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects">tree</a> and that they are represented as files
      in the <i>.git/objects</i> folder. The <i>git log</i> command shows commit logs with details about each commit.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
  > git log

  commit 6092402952852e69abaf9f1e84624a804f081c88

    </code></pre>
    <p>
      These logs also include commit hash. The internal representations of objects in Git are compressed but luckily git
      offers a set of <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain">plumbing
        commands</a> for inspection of git objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>git cat-file</i> command can show us the internal representation of a commit. We use a commit hash obtained
      from git log.
    </p>
    <pre><code>

        mode</a> is a really nice feature provided by the GitHub platform which allows verification of commit
      signatures. <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work">Signing commits</a> is a feature
      of Git.
      Signing can be set up in an automated way. Vigilant mode automatically flags all commits on the GitHub platform
      that do not contain a valid GPG signature.
    </p>
    <p>
      GPG is a tool used for secure asymmetric cryptographic operations.<br>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">Asymmetric cryptography</a> uses a combination of
      private and public keys. If Alice holds the private key, she can use it to either encrypt or sign messages. Bob,
      who holds the public key, can then either decrypt or verify these messages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are some interesting documentation links: <a
        href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/generating-a-new-gpg-key">How
        to generate GPG key pair</a> and <a
        href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits">Automatically
        sign each commit</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once I have set up the GPG keys, I will try to execute one more commit. This commit will be signed using the
      <i>-S</i> git flag.

      alt="Picture of SIGNED commit on GitHub, the commit shows that its created by Cupprum and that the commit is verified.">
    <p>
    <p>
      This new commit is tagged as verified because GitHub was able to verify the commit's signature using the public
      key that I uploaded to the GitHub platform. Essentially, this means we can now mathematically prove the origin of
      the
      commit.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can also inspect how the signed commit differs from a normal commit.

      There are also other methods for creating verified commits on the GitHub platform.
    </h3>
    <p>
      All the commits created on the platform itself (edits in GitHub, or in Github Codespaces) are automatically signed
      by short-lived GPG keys handled by GitHub.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good thing about this automated way of signing commits on the GitHub platform is that it is fully automated
      and does not require any initial setup.
    </p>
    <h3 style="color: #555;">
      Why should I care about code signing?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Signing commits can make it more difficult for malicious parties to smuggle in code. This can be particularly
      useful for release managers. Checking whether all commits have been signed before publishing a release could help
      prevent some issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Signed commits also help with traceability in case unwanted code is found.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Gitea's <a href="https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/4167">infrastructure was compromised</a>, they
      began <a href="https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/4374">signing their releases</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opinions on this subject vary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some people advocate that signing only releases is enough. Others believe that once GPG keys are set up, it's easy
      to configure automated signing of commits, so we might as well also sign the commits. Another group of people
      argues that by signing each commit, we load the key into memory more often. This means that if an attacker has
      access to a machine, they will not be able to access the key when it's properly stored, but the key might be found
      in memory unencrypted. Different opinion is that people do not want to rotate their keys frequently. Yet another
      opinion is using <a
        href="https://www.gnupg.org/howtos/card-howto/en/ch05s02.html#:~:text=Subkeys%20are%20keys%20to%20use,single%20private%20key%20are%20possible.">Subkeys</a>
      to solve the issue of rotating keys. To which the majority of people without a concrete opinion answer that the
      overhead of this whole signing setup is getting too complicated to manage properly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the recent years, a new standard for signing also emerged, <a
        href="https://www.sigstore.dev/how-it-works">sigstore</a>. It promises to simplify the key management by using
      short-lived keys. By simplifying the key management, this solution should scale nicer. This standard however
      targets signing only releases and not commits themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sigstore is a response to the increasing number of supply chain attacks. The project is now under the <a
        href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/press-release/linux-foundation-announces-free-sigstore-signing-service-to-confirm-origin-and-authenticity-of-software">Linux

      and <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2021/03/introducing-sigstore-easy-code-signing.html">Google</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.python.org/download/sigstore/">CPython</a> and <a
        href="https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/05/03/kubernetes-1-24-release-announcement/#signing-release-artifacts">Kubernetes</a>
      are among the first larger projects to sign their releases with sigstore.
    </p>
