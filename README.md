The purpose of this repository is to show how easy it is to 'spoof' commits on GitHub. Take a look at the commit history. All those commits were done by me personally.

### Website:
The following [Hackernews post](https://cupprum.github.io/git-gpg-signing/) explains the topic closer. 

### Development:
This website is supposed to be as simple as possible, so i that i do not have to spend my time maintaining it. The post is a plain html file, which contains basic css. It is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages).
